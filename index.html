	<p>Welcome to my space!  </p>
	<p>With a background in statistics, my interest lies in data. I have always worked as a Data Analyst and now as a postgraduate researcher in the Data Science field.  </p>
	<p>Having completed an MSc at the Alliance Business School in Business Analytics: Risk Analysis and Operational Research. I'm currently enrolled in a 4 year integrated PhD programmme in the <a href="https://datacdt.org/">Data CDT Doctoral Training</a> which is fully funded by the <a href="http://www.esrc.ac.uk/">Economic and Social Research Council</a>.

	<ul>
		<li style="font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.4em; color: #333;">I am currently engaged in two projcets (1) I am working as a contract People MI Analyst at BUPA. In this role, I work with People -HR- 
		data to create reports using sickness data (impact of COVID), report evaluating the impact of BREXIT on workers, a wholistic  MI people Dashboard which covers key metrics on turnover,
		absences, learning, performance, recruitment analysis and headcount data. I was speciifically contracted to help the team transition to the use of PowerBI instead of excel. 
		To do this, I coach other teams in the use of PowerBI, run weekly knowledge transfer sessions, create guides, templates and workflows. (2) I am working on a business challenge 
		developed for postgraduate researchers to transfer and apply their knowledge to business problems. In particular, I have applied project management, business analyst and data analytical skills
		in understanding the business problem, develop feasible solutions given the short period of time and implement these solutions. I work in a group of three talented 
		postgraduate researchers. In the course of this project, we have deveeloped a suite of project management documentation - project defintion document, work breakdown structure,
		risk log, smart goals, project plan (on Asana). We are now at the delivery stage after pitching our idea and winning the bid. I will be leading the quantitative 
		data analytical workstream, as well as the self appointed project manager.
		Oh and I continue to work on my PhD - one more year to go. I do have other projects in the pipeline. can't wait to share</li>
		
		<li style="font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.4em; color: #333;">With years of experience working as a data 
		analyst and in particular working with PowerBI, between April 2019 and April 2020 I worked with the Department for Education (DfE) as a 
		contract performance analyst. I used PowerBI to create automatically refreshed reports (including amazing visuals and some sprinkle of predictions -obviously) 
		to aid in insight generation. I also monitored website usage using Google Analytics (GA), using Google Data Studio 
		(connected to GA) to creat customised reports.</li>
		<li style="font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.4em; color: #333;">In February 2019, I worked with 
		<a href="http://mlm.humanities.manchester.ac.uk"> Multi-lingual Manchester </a> to help curate the 
		International Mother Language Day events here in Manchester. This was very different from the usual data 
		analytics projects I work on, but very much aligns with me as something I value (being multilingual and 
		working on getting my kids multilingual). My role entailed coming up with games that explores the various 
		languages spoken in manchester, working with a couple of libraries in planning and organising their events and 
		on the day running a session</li>
		<li style="font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.4em; color: #333;">Over the summer (2018), I worked with the 
		University of Manchester <a href="http://www.library.manchester.ac.uk/using-the-library/students/specialist-learning/business-data-service/">Business Data Service</a> 
		where I created <a href="https://medium.com/using-specialist-business-databases">online resources</a> to guide 
		current students and researchers. A <a href="https://umlteachinglearning.wordpress.com/2018/09/11/digital-humanities-pgr-placement-in-the-library-summer-2018/">blog post</a> 
		by the Teaching and Learning Team summarises my time with them.  </li>
		<li style="font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.4em; color: #333;">For five days in April 2018, I was part of The 
		Alan Turing Institute's <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/collaborate-turing/data-study-groups">Data Study 
		Group</a>. This was an opportunity to meet fellow researchers, hear industy problems that can be solved with 
		data science and attempting to solve them. I would include link of final output when it becomes avaliable.</li>
