	<p>Welcome to my space! I'm Noelyn Onah and as the word cloud above captures, my interest lies in data. With a background in statistics, I work as a Data Analyst and now a postgraduate researcher in the Data Science field.  </p>
	<p>I'm currently enrolled in a 4 year integrated PhD programmme in the <a href="https://datacdt.org/">Data CDT Doctoral Training</a>. My research would be to use data analytics to explore the connection and impact of social science and economics in the world of healthcare. </p>
        <p>The first year entails a masters programme in which I am doing a Programming for Social Scientist's course. This is done using Python and <a href="https://onah-noelyn.github.io/ABM">here</a> is an agent based model I produced on the 1st week of the course.</p>
	<p>You can learn more about what am doing and contact me using the details below. </p>
