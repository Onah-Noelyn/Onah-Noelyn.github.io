	<p>Welcome to my space! </p>
	<p>I'm Noelyn and as the word cloud highlights, my interest lies in data. With a background in statistics, I have always worked as a Data Analyst and now as a postgraduate researcher in the Data Science field.  </p>
	<p>I'm currently enrolled in a 4 year integrated PhD programmme in the <a href="https://datacdt.org/">Data CDT Doctoral Training</a> which is fully funded by the <a href="http://www.esrc.ac.uk/">Economic and Social Research Council</a>. My research is focused at the use of data analytics to explore the connection and impact of social science and economics in the world of healthcare. </p>
        <p>The first year of my studies entail a masters programme in which I am doing a Programming for Social Scientist's course. This is done using Python and my first task is to build an agent based model. </p>
	<p>This model is geared to create an environment of agents, these agents are able to interact with each other and the environment. This interaction involves agents moving, eating, sharing and storing away the environment. This is shown in the below animation through the observable change in colour. Press play to see.</p>

	</div>
	<script> 
        var agents = document.getElementById("animation"); 
        function playPause() { 
        	if (agents.paused) 
        	    agents.play(); 
        	else 
        	    agents.pause(); 
       	} 
	</script>
