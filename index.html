	<p>Welcome to my space! I'm Noelyn and as the word cloud above highlights, my interest lies in data. With a background in statistics, I have always worked as a Data Analyst and now a postgraduate researcher in the Data Science field.  </p>
	<p>I'm currently enrolled in a 4 year integrated PhD programmme in the <a href="https://datacdt.org/">Data CDT Doctoral Training</a>. My research would be to use data analytics to explore the connection and impact of social science and economics in the world of healthcare. </p>
        <p>The first year of my studies entail a masters programme in which I am doing a Programming for Social Scientist's course. This is done using Python and my first task was to build an agent based model. </p>
	<p>This model is geared to create a fixed set of agents, these agents can interact with each other and their environment which can be seen in an animated plot produced. The code I have written for this can be found on this <a href="https://github.com/Onah-Noelyn/Agent_Based_Model">github repositary</a> </p>
	<p>You can learn more about what am doing and contact me using the details below. </p>
